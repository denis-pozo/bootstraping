# Bootstrap Project 
*for Mac OS (Mojave 10.14.5)*

This repository contains the required scripts and dotfiles to export my configuration to any machine.

## How to use it?

> Note: Running the bootstrap script (bootstrap.sh) will create symlinks of the dotfiles in your HOME directory, overriding your own ones. Please, make a security copy of your dotfiles somewhere else before.

1. Install git
2. Clone this repository in any directory
3. Run sh bootstrap.sh
